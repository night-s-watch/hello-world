zhaohangbo begins his new journey

When I was a little boy , I was interested in science ,determined to be a scient.
When I was a teenager   , I thought I would be someone importent just like the great leader in history book.
I learned piano , I was addicted to computer games and  baskedball.
I also dreamed to be a musian , a basketball player , an entrepreneur.

Then I experienced a period of suppressing myself to get excellent grades.
I Forget to follow my passion and do what I love.

I am determined to be someone great , but I am not determined which way to go.

Now I am 25. And now I am learning software engineering.
